upload_dataset_main.py is the Main Function.
UploadDataset_config.json takes all the arugemts we need to pass. We can execute by passing 1 or more datasets.
If we pass multiple datasets, then all the datasets will be pushed in parallel. So we are covering Parallel Processing datas push here as well.
To add datasets path make sure to insert a key having prefix in there variable names as "dataset_path".

To run the script the command will be :-
python3 upload_dataset_main.py <path of UploadDataset_config.json>

Elaborating (output = process.stdout.readline().decode().strip()) in "jobManager_portForward.py"
    process.stdout: This refers to the standard output stream of a subprocess.
    readline(): This method reads a single line from the standard output stream of the subprocess.
    decode(): This method decodes the bytes-like object returned by readline() into a string. The decoding is typically done using a specified encoding, but in this case, it's likely using the default encoding.
    strip(): This method removes leading and trailing whitespace from the string.
